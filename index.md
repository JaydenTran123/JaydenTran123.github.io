## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 06, part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs because it was so easy to do yet so fun. We were able to create a program that allowed us to use command line arguments and input what we want in our sandwich in a certain order to print out the desired result. After we finished the lab, I would just keep replaying the same program to create many variations of sandwiches that no one would probably want to eat.

    This one has to be my favorite lab because I enjoy playing blackjack(without the betting of course). It was not the easiest lab to do, but we had to write many functions that required a lot of if statements to determine what card it was and what value needed to be assigned to it, so it was pretty tedious. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed playing the same and now that I was able to program it, I can play by myself. Although it is not necessarily like the real game, it was pretty fun to play.

* Lab 12, part 2

    This was my third favorite lab because it was a bit challenging. This was the first time that we were able to use a pseudo-random number generator to generate pixels randomly to create the background picture. However, this was the first time that we got to program a gif with a message and I really enjoyed it because it was so cool seeing the finished product. In addition, we got to customize our own message that made it more special knowing that I could send it to people for the holidays.
