I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduation in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 06, part 1
This was one of my favorite labs because it was so easy to do yet so fun. We were able to create a program that used command line arguments to build our own sandwich. After we finished the lab, I would just keep replaying the same program to create many variations of sandwiches that no one would probably want to eat. 

* Lab 06, part 2
This one has to be my favorite lab because I enjoy playing blackjack(without the betting of course). It was not the easiest lab to do, but I enjoyed the finished product. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed playing the same and now that I was able to program it, I can play by myself. Although it is not necessarily like the real game, it was pretty fun to play.

* Lab 12, part 2
This was my third favorite lab because it was a bit challenging. However, this was the first time that we got to program a gif with a message and I really enjoyed it because it was so cool seeing the finished product. In addition, we got to customize our own message that made it more special knowing that I could send it to people for the holidays.
